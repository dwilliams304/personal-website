      fullDescription: "Hello friend. This project doesn't currently have a full description (yet). \
        \n But here's a brief description in the meantime! \
        \n 'Neon Rain' is a 2D top-down shooter game made within the Unity game engine. It utilizes the C# \
          language and this project was made with a few ideas in mind. The first idea is that I wanted to be able \
          to make a game (of course). The second idea is that I wanted to challenge myself. Making games is a very complex \
          thing to do and this project works as a way for me to be able to have these very difficult problems that I need to \
          figure out how to break down into smaller problems and solve it programmatically. It's been no easy task, for sure. \
        \n I have an immense passion for software development and all things around it. Web development, game development, you name \
          it. I love being able to make things that people can interact with and use (and even maybe use very often) that works well \
          and not only works well, but is actually enjoyable to interact with. (We all know of those websites/tools you have to use often \
          but aren't the most fun to use.) \
        \n While I don't have a fully fleshed out description yet, I do plan on eventually adding one. If you do have any questions \
          feel free to ask me through the contact form, LinkedIn, over the phone, anything. And I'd love to asnwer your questions.",
